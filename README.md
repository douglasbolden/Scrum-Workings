# Scrum-Workings
This is a repository that is used for the sole purpose of allowing people to read a Review/Retrospective that I wrote for the fictitious company, SNHU Travel, which was created by Southern New Hampshire University.
This repository is also used to view a Microsoft Power Point Presentation about the Scrum-Agile Framework.
